# IPR_DiffusionModel_FreeU

This is a text to image generation code that uses pre-trained stable diffusion model and adds FreeU technique to scale image features and get enhanced version of the image.
The .ipynb code can be directly run on google colab/kaggle notebook.
Or you can run IPR_project.ipynb on any python jupytor notebook by first installing the necessary libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt
The prompts can be given as inputs in the "examples" list of the code and then used to generate images using "infer" function.
The infer function takes the prompts as well as the factor b1,b2,s1 and s2 as inputs.
